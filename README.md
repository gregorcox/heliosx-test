# About

This app allows users to complete a consultation to determine their sutability for allergy medication. Once the user completes the consultation questions, their answers will be logged in the console.

The app currently logs the answers as an array of "Yes" or "No" strings, but would be ammended based on the requirements of the backend endpoint.

The app allows adding more yes/no question strings to the questions array without further ammendments to the code.

The app uses the following technologies:

- React.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
